# Dynamic Collection Manager - Environment Configuration
# This file shows the minimal required environment variables for the new dynamic collection system

# Airtable Configuration
# Get your Airtable Personal Access Token from: https://airtable.com/create/tokens
AIRTABLE_TOKEN=your_airtable_token_here

# Shopify Configuration
# Get your Shopify Admin API access token from your Shopify app settings
SHOPIFY_ADMIN_TOKEN=your_shopify_admin_token_here

# Shopify shop domain (without https://, e.g., your-shop.myshopify.com)
SHOPIFY_SHOP_DOMAIN=your_shop_domain_here

# IMPORTANT: Per-Collection Configuration
# ============================================================================
# The following settings are no longer configured via environment variables.
# Instead, they are configured per collection using Shopify metafields:
#
# For each collection that should be automated:
# 1. Name the collection starting with "Auto -" (e.g., "Auto - Top Resell Products")
# 2. Add a metafield with:
#    - Namespace: custom
#    - Key: job_settings
#    - Type: JSON
#    - Value: Collection-specific configuration
#
# Example job_settings metafield value:
# {
#   "jobType": "getTopResellProducts",
#   "Description": "Based Airtable Sales Data of Spain, we automatically update this collection for resell products",
#   "AIRTABLE_BASE_ID": "appDE0y01TchMqX8N",
#   "AIRTABLE_TABLE_ID": "tbljkyhWy5D6b65Im",
#   "AIRTABLE_VIEW_ID": "viwixRrDpjcAYwHId",
#   "UPDATE_FREQUENCY_HOURS": "24",
#   "MAX_AIRTABLE_RECORDS": "500"
# }
#
# Benefits of this approach:
# - Multiple collections can have different data sources and update frequencies
# - No need to redeploy code when adding new collections
# - Each collection can be independently configured and monitored
# - Easy to enable/disable collections by removing the metafield
